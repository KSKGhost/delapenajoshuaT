<br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">Born on July 31, 2003, in the enchanting province of Isabela in the Philippines, my name is Joshua Dela Peña. My life journey has been a captivating tapestry of experiences, each chapter adding depth and color to my personal narrative.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Early Days in Cauayan City, Isabela</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Cauayan City, Isabela, with its lush landscapes and warm-hearted people, serves as the backdrop to the opening chapters of my life story. These were the formative years when I was introduced to the world of education at Cauayan South Central School, where wonder and discovery were the norm. From grade 1 to grade 6, I eagerly took my first steps in learning, guided by passionate educators and supported by a close-knit community. It was during this time that I formed friendships that would become lifelong bonds, companions throughout the early stages of my journey. These early years nurtured a profound sense of curiosity and a deep love for exploring the world around me.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">High School Years and First Love</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Transitioning to high school at Cauayan City National High School Main marked a pivotal moment in my life's trajectory. It signaled the shift from childhood to adolescence, a time of increased responsibilities but also of immense growth and self-discovery. Diligently, I pursued my studies, ever determined to improve my skills and expand my horizons.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">During my high school years, I ventured into the realm of romantic relationships, a common experience for many teenagers. I had a girlfriend during this time, and like most teenage romances, it was marked by its fair share of ups and downs. While it didn't culminate in a lifelong partnership, this experience became a crucible of invaluable lessons about communication, empathy, and resilience. These lessons, learned through the intricacies of young love, continue to influence my personal growth and interactions with others.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">The Pursuit of Higher Education and the IT World</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Upon completing my secondary education, I stood at a pivotal crossroads, faced with the decision of my future path. Fueled by a profound fascination with technology and a burning desire to be a part of the ever-evolving digital world, I resolved to pursue a degree in Information Technology (IT) at Isabela State University, Cauayan Campus. This monumental decision marked the dawn of the next chapter in my journey.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">My time at Isabela State University has been a dynamic blend of challenges and accomplishments. The IT program, characterized by its rigorous coursework, provided me with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the intricate landscape of the digital realm. I delved into coding, troubleshooting, and harnessed technology to address real-world issues. The academic environment, in addition to preparing me for my future career, also facilitated my personal growth and provided opportunities for leadership and self-discovery.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Throughout my university experience, I actively engaged in extracurricular activities, joining clubs and organizations that resonated with my interests and values. This engagement allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals and contributed to causes that I'm passionate about. These experiences added a layer of depth to my journey, enriching my university life and preparing me for the challenges that lay ahead.</p>
